# Vehicle-Service-Station-Simulation
Overview
This project simulates the operations of a vehicle service center that handles multiple vehicle maintenance tasks such as washing, oil changes, and cleaning.
The simulation models the interactions between service advisors, technicians, and arriving vehicles under different demand conditions.

The simulation helps analyze:
  Average waiting times
  Staff utilization (advisors & technicians)
  Vehicle throughput under varying workloads

How to Run:
Open the notebook file
Run the cell

The simulation automatically runs all three scenarios and prints:
  Vehicles Served
  Average Waiting Time
  Throughput (vehicles/hour)
  Advisor Utilization (%)
  Technician Utilization (%)
Graphs will also be generated comparing performance metrics across scenarios.
